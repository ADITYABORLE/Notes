# Simple Material Notes
===================================================================================
- This is a simple no-frills note taking app with material design, meant for taking down a quick note or list. 
- Notes are saved automatically so you never have to worry about losing anything. 
- The entire user interface can be customised with your favourite colours and you can use the built-in search function to search for any of your older notes.
- There is also Tasker support to read / write notes and to receive events when a note is updated.
